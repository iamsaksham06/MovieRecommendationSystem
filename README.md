# Movie Recommendation System

There are two types of recommendation system -

1. Content based
   
   Content-based recommendation systems recommend items similar to those the user has liked or interacted with in the past. This similarity is determined based on the attributes or features of the items.

2. Collaborative filtering
   
   Collaborative filtering makes recommendations by identifying patterns in user behavior, typically by analyzing user-item interaction data. It doesn't rely on item attributes but rather on the preferences of other users.

We are designing a content based recommandation system using a big dataset

# Dataset Used 

MovieLens 100k Dataset

It contains many files which gives us vast information about data. 

This data set consists of:

* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
* Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
* Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)

The data was collected during the seven-month period from September 19th, 1997 through April 22nd, 1998.
